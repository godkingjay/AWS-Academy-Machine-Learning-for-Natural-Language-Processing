    "# Lab 6.2: Implementing Topic Extraction with NTM\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will use the Amazon SageMaker Neural Topic Model (NTM) algorithm to extract topics from the [20 Newsgroups](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups) dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Amazon SageMaker Neural Topic Model (NTM) is an unsupervised learning algorithm that attempts to describe a set of observations as a mixture of distinct categories. NTM is most commonly used to discover a user-specified number of topics that are shared by documents within a text corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each observation is a document, the features are the presence (or occurrence count) of each word, and the categories are the topics. Because the method is unsupervised, the topics are not specified up front and are not guaranteed to align with how a human might naturally categorize documents. The topics are learned as a probability distribution over the words that occur in each document. Each document, in turn, is described as a mixture of topics. For more information, see [Neural Topic Model (NTM) Algorithm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ntm.html) in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.\n",

    "\n",
    "## About this dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. This collection has become a popular dataset for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering. In this lab, you will see what topics you can learn from this set of documents using the Neural Topic Model (NTM) algorithm.\n",

When you use the `FullyReplicated` mode on training data, the training time per epoch is slower (nearly 1.5 times in this example), and it defeats the purpose of distributed training.
